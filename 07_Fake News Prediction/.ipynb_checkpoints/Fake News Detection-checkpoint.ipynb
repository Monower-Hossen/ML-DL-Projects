    "# Project 06 :Fake News Detection Using Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of misinformation in digital media has emphasized the need for automated fake news detection. This study explores the application of linear regression, a traditional machine learning approach, for classifying news articles as real or fake. The model utilizes textual features extracted from news content to predict the likelihood of an article being fake. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are evaluated to assess the model’s effectiveness. Although linear regression is primarily a regression technique, its application in binary classification through thresholding demonstrates moderate success, highlighting both the challenges and potential of traditional models in tackling fake news detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid dissemination of information through social media and online news platforms has increased the prevalence of fake news, which can mislead public opinion and influence societal behavior. Automated detection of fake news is essential to mitigate its adverse effects. While modern approaches often rely on deep learning and neural networks, this project investigates the use of linear regression, a simpler and interpretable model, to classify news articles as real or fake based on textual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a linear regression model for fake news detection.\n",
    "* Evaluate its performance using standard classification metrics.\n",
    "* Analyze the advantages and limitations of linear regression in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research in fake news detection has largely focused on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches:** Utilizing TF-IDF, word embeddings, and linguistic cues.\n",
    "* **Machine Learning algorithms:** Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.\n",
    "* **Deep learning models:** LSTM, BERT, and transformer-based architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is typically used for predicting continuous variables, but with proper thresholding, it can serve as a simple baseline for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this study contains news articles labeled as `real` or `fake`. Each article includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Title\n",
    "* Text content\n",
    "* Class (0 = real, 1 = fake)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing steps included:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Removing stopwords and punctuation.\n",
    "* Lowercasing all text.\n",
    "* Converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) is employed to convert text data into numerical vectors that capture the importance of words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Although linear regression is a regression model, it can approximate probabilities for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n $$\n",
    "where $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted value. Thresholding is applied such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{label} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if } \\hat{y} \\geq 0.5 \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if } \\hat{y} < 0.5\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance is measured using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy\n",
    "* Precision\n",
    "* Recall\n",
    "* F1-score\n",
    "* Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics allow a comprehensive understanding of the model’s classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression provides a simple and interpretable approach to fake news detection. Its strengths include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy implementation and low computational cost.\n",
    "* Transparency in understanding feature contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Poor handling of complex, non-linear relationships in textual data.\n",
    "* Sensitivity to feature scaling and multicollinearity.\n",
    "* Lower performance compared to specialized classifiers such as logistic regression or deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates that linear regression can serve as a baseline model, but advanced models are recommended for real-world deployment.\n"
